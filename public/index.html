                The Arctic Monkeys were formed in mid-2002 by friends Alex Turner, Matt Helders, and Andy
                Nicholson.Turner and Helders were neighbours and close friends, and they met Nicholson in
                secondary school. Turner, who had grown up in a musical household as his father was a music
                teacher, played guitar in the then-instrumental-only band, with Helders on drums, Nicholson on bass, and
                a new band member, Jamie Cook as a second guitarist. The name "Arctic Monkeys" was Cook's idea,
                and is perhaps a play on "northern monkey", a derogatory term for someone from northern England.
                Initially, Turner was reluctant when it came to being the lead singer. As time passed, Turner became
                the lead singer and frontman of the band as he had "a thing for words", according to Helders. The
                band began rehearsing at Yellow Arch Studios in Neepsend and played its first gig on 13 June 2003 at
                The Grapes in Sheffield city centre. After a few performances in 2003, the band began to record
                demos at 2fly studios in Sheffield.

                Arctic Monkeys' musical style has been mainly described as indie rock, garage
                rock, post-punk revival, psychedelic rock, alternative rock,
                post-Britpop, stoner rock, guitar pop, post-punk, punk rock, and
                hard rock. A key part of their sound, and one that translates across their whole discography, is
                Turner's intricate and often rapidly delivered lyrics, sung in a distinctive strong Sheffield accent
                that their music became famed for in their early years. The punk poet John Cooper Clarke was a
                formative influence on Turner; his poem "I Wanna Be Yours" was adapted into a track on the band's fifth
                album AM
